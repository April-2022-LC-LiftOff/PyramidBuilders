# PyramidBuilders

Our project is a web application where users can browse reviews, create a profile, and post reviews of their own.

## Features
* All users (regardless of account status) are able to browse, search, filter, and sort all reviews.
* Users with a registered account can create a profile which includes a photo, bio, and the ability to tag their interests from a provided list.
* Registered users can create, edit, and delete reviews for given categories (MVP is movies)
* Registered users can “favorite” other users’ reviews, causing those reviews to populate in the “Favorites” section of the user’s profile for easy future reference. 

## Languages & Tools
* Java, JavaScript
* MySQL, Spring Boot
* Either Thymeleaf templates or Angular

## What We'll Learn
We will use Google Maps API for the “maps view” search option, in order to display where the selected movie is showing near the user.

## Future Iterations
* Additional categories (current ideas: books, restaurants, hotels)
* Ability to “favorite” user accounts, allowing new reviews from that account in the main feed so the user sees it first.
